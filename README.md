# Room Card Plus

Room Card Plus is a Bubble Card module I’ve been templating and refining for a couple of years, and I decided to share it as a bubble card module.

The main goal of this card is **flexibility**: almost every visual aspect can be customized, either statically or through optional conditions.

In the left is my original templated card and in the right the module.

## ✨ Features

### 🧱 Layout & Text
- Adjustable title and state positioning
- Fine control over spacing and padding
- Responsive text sizing for mobile and desktop

### 🎨 Main Icon Customization
- Change the main icon dynamically
- Control icon color, animation, and background
- Optional background opacity when the main entity is `off`
- Rule-based styling using conditions (or static values if you prefer)

### 🔘 Sub-buttons
- Slim sub-button layout
- Control size, gap, radius, and number of columns
- Designed to adapt cleanly to different dashboard styles

### ⭐ Entity States (My Favourite Feature)
Instead of using the default entity state, you can define your own **Entity States**:
- Pick one or multiple entities
- Choose whether to show text, icon, or both
- Apply per-entity colors, animations, ordering, and conditions
- Build compact, meaningful state summaries for a room or area

This makes it easy to replace a single state string with a rich, highly customizable status row.
